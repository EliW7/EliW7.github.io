### CPSC 120

* Lab 04.  
   
   This lab teach me how to create a basic game style program. It is funny to test it in different ways. Additionally, this lab is relatively easier than what when we go farther within this class.

  Lab 05 
   I like the backjack game. Although this lab is more complicated than the lab 04, this is a game program. Once figure out the sequence of the program and readme file that become easy. 

   Lab 07 
   I particularly like part 2 because I've always been interested in how the game of blackjack operates. For the first time, I was able to create methods that determine a Blackjack hand's correct value regardless of how many Aces were given.
